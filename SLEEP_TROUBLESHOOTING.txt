If your screen sleeps or won't wake, make sure HDMI and DPMS settings are not blanking the display.
Recommended Pi OS settings:

1) Disable console blanking (KMS/console):
   sudo sed -i 's/$/ consoleblank=0/' /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt

2) Disable DPMS for X11 (run once in a session):
   xset s off
   xset -dpms
   xset s noblank

You can also use the Debug tab -> Wake Display to send VCP D6 power on.
